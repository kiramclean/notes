    " ## General notes on ruby\n",
    " - Everything in ruby is an object, which means you can call methods on anything (strings, fixnums, ints, etc.)\n",
    " - You can send methods dynamically using .send(:method_name)\n",
    " - You can write anything you want in the body of a class, including a method that applies to the class itself\n",
    "   - To write a class method, prepend it with self.\n",
    " - `extend` adds all methods in the module as class level methods\n",
    " - `include` adds all methods in the module as instance level methods\n",
    " - Procs are objects like everything else and are used to wrap blocks so you can access them\n",
    "   - Blocks are one thing that are NOT objects in ruby -- means you can't call methods on them\n",
    " - Lambdas check the arguments (and number of arguments) passed to them, procs don't\n",
    " - Lambdas return where `return` is called (i.e. exit the lambda), procs return from the enclosing method\n",
    " - `yield` keyword executes a block passed to a method"
