## 5 things I wish I knew before I started coding
**Kerri Miller** _@kerrizor_

1. It's supposed to be hard
  - there is no way for a computer to explain to us what's wrong
  - you're trying to learn to communicate with a pile of metal and glass, of course it's hard
  - solve a problem first, then refine that solution
2. You do you
  - don't waste time trying to fit in
  - it's ok to struggle, it's ok to not know the answer
  - find your strengths and own them
  - don't be ashamed or scared of having weaknesses -- everybody does, they just might be different
3. There is no magic
  - computers can literally only follow intructions
  - there has to be a reason why the thing is not working
4. Learn how to learn
  - you will never stop learning and you will never be done learning something
5. Find your community
  - if you can't find one, make one
  - it's good to share learning and teach others
6. Get started
  - whatever you're waiting for will never happen
  - just get staretd with something

## How to give a good technical talk
**Jen Kramer** _@jen4web_

- don't be boring
- don't include everything you know
- begin with the end in mind (and go read the 7 habits of highly effective people)

**Before you start**
Answer these questions:
- what do you want the audience to say when they leave?
- how do you want the audience to feel?
- what do you want them to remember?
- what do you want them to do next?

1. Assume nothing
  - start slow, assume nothing about what your audience knows

  Answer these questions:
  - what is your technology's pedigree (who made it, who supports it, how old is it, who uses it?)
  - what is your connection to it?
  - what other technology is like this?
  - how is this different/better than that?
  - what problems does it solve?
  - what are the disadvantages?
  - what compromises do you have to make?

2. Build gradually
  - don't try to be comprehensive
  - pick a focus and stick with it
  - provide references to learn more so you don't go too deep
  - show, don't tell (use visuals)

3. It's not about you
  - it's about the audience
  - goal is to teach them something, not show off your own skills
  - if you teach your audience, you will be a leader in your field
  - a tight, focused message is better than a comprehensive dissertation

- estimate ~1 min. per slide
- start and end on time, out of respect for your audience and the conference organizers
  - put some stuff at the end you can cut out if you run out of time
- ask the audience questions
- don't worry about getting a question you can't answer
  - admit it, maybe suggest a possible answer, then turn it back to the audience

- stick with the outline PROBLEM --> SOLUTION --> EXAMPLE
