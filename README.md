# Notes

A blog post is sometimes overkill for getting a simple concept across.

These are short and sweet notes from my adventures learning how to code, mostly in javascript, ruby, and elixir.

Some are ipython notebooks that you can view right here on github or at at [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

The rest are markdown files, which are also best viewed right here.

Happy coding!
